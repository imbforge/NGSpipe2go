# SNP calling on RNAseq data pipeline

**Important NOTE: this is a legacy pipeline using GATK3, which is now obsolete. There's no plans to upgrade the pipeline to GATK4, and it is actually unsupported by BCF. Use the pipeline at your own risk.**

### What it will it do

Heavily undocumented, but it will identify SNP from RNA-seq data using GATK best practices. Features a 2-step mapping approach with STAR. 

To be Documented at a later stage.

### Prerequisites

- picard tools (> 1.119)
- GenomeAnalysisTK version 3. **Please note it is obsolete**
